# AuthMat â€” Distributed Authentication and Authorization System

**AuthMat** is a modular authentication and authorization platform built with Spring Boot, designed to serve as the security backbone for distributed systems and microservice-based architectures. It handles user identity, token lifecycle management, and access control in a scalable and maintainable way.

## Key Features

- **Secure Authentication and Authorization**
  - Supports user registration, login, credential updates, and session management via RESTful APIs.
  - Issues access and refresh tokens using JWTs, with Redis-backed validations for performance.

- **Token-Based Access Control**
  - Stateless token flows for authentication.
  - Internal library for issuing/verifying JWTs using rotating asymmetric keys.

- **Admin Management Tools**
  - Admin capabilities for user moderation, credential resets, and enforcing account restrictions like bans or access revocation.

- **Optimized for Performance and Scalability**
  - Redis for sub-100ms user status lookups (e.g. roles, permissions, account state).
  - Java Virtual Threads enable high-concurrency, non-blocking request handling.
  - PostgreSQL persistence with tuned indexes for fast querying.

- **Developer-Friendly Integration**
  - Designed to integrate easily with external services via secure HTTP APIs.
  - Token library published to GitHub Packages for reuse across services.

- **Minimal Frontend**
  - Lightweight HTML/CSS/JS interface (served via Node.js) for basic account management.

## Use Cases

- Microservices that need a plug-and-play authentication and authorization provider
- Distributed applications needing a central identity service
- Internal tools that require secure user management and RBAC

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot
